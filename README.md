## ipse

ipse is:

> an experimental game for Android that encourages players to rethink their own identities by having them create avatars that are only collections of sounds and energy, offering a new perspective on interacting with others and exploring the world. Genre-wise, it might be considered an "art game": a game that uses its gameplay to tell a narrative that offers a commentary about life, rather than focusing on just creating a fun but shallow experience.

# NOTE: This project is NOT in active development.

This project has not been touched since **May 15, 2011**. I wasn't using Git at the time, but I'm going through and putting my old code on GitHub for the following reasons:

1. as a general personal archive of my own code-based projects
2. to showcase the wide variety of work I have done for professional purposes
3. to make my work available to others to reuse รก la open-source

Please don't contact me with bug reports, submit pull requests, etc. You are free to fork this repository and expand on this project if you like (in accordance with the Apache v2 license), but in that case you are responsible for maintaining your fork, including bugs that may (and probably do) exist in my code.
